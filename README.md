Fastag is an electronic toll collection system used on highways to facilitate seamless travel and reduce congestion. 
However, fraudulent activities within the Fastag system pose significant challenges, leading to financial losses and compromised security.

The following FastTag Fraud detection Utilizes several ML Algorithms to help predict fradulent Transactions. For Example if a heavy truck pays amount that is for a car then the system should flag as Fraud.
This is a Classification Problem

Overview

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning classification methods to create a reliable fraud detection system tailored for FASTag transactions. By analyzing essential data features like transaction records, vehicle details, geographic locations, and transaction values, the system aims to identify fraudulent activities with high accuracy. The ultimate goal is to ensure the security and reliability of FASTag transactions by mitigating the risks associated with fraud.

Project Objectives:

Exploratory Data Analysis: 
The data indicates that Lane B102 records the highest number of fraudulent transactions. This finding underscores the need to prioritize enhanced security measures and monitoring systems in this lane to reduce the risk of fraud.

The analysis reveals peak times for fraudulent activity, with the highest occurrences recorded at 4 PM, 10 PM, and 6 AM. These insights highlight critical time windows where monitoring and preventive measures should be intensified to effectively combat fraud.

The analysis identifies large vehicles, especially SUVs and Vans, as the most frequently involved in fraudulent activities. Additionally, Sedans and Trucks also exhibit notable levels of involvement, suggesting the need for targeted monitoring and preventive measures across these vehicle types.


Results
The Logistic Regression demonstrated the best performance with the following metrics:

Accuracy - 0.782  
Precision -0.782783  
Recall - 0.998723 
F1    - 0.877666
